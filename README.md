# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

When you just finished cloning the Loyalty app, you will need to install the node_module folder in order to use the app libraries.
To install the node_modules folder:

### `yarn`

This command will automatically download all the libraries used in the app.

Make sure that your current location in the directory is Loyalty.
For example: ~/Downloads/Loyalty UI đồ án MIS/Loyalty (This is the correct location)
           : ~/Downloads/Loyalty UI đồ án MIS (This is not the correct location)
If your current location is incorrect, use the "cd" command to change directory location.
For example: If your current location is ~/Downloads/Loyalty UI đồ án MIS, type: 

### `cd Loyalty`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, to run the front-end of the app:

### `yarn start`

The UI of the website will appear in your web browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
The back-end uses port 3000 to connect to the database. When starting the front-end, it may ask you to use another port for front-end. Make sure to type "yes" or "y" in order to allow the front-end to change its port.

To run the back-end of the app:

### `yarn build`

This will connect your app to the database and fetch the data to your website.
You will also see errors in the console if anything went wrong.
